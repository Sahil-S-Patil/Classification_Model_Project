# Classification_Model_Project
### This project demonstrates the use of various machine learning classifiers for a classification task. The goal is to build models using multiple algorithms, evaluate their performance, and compare metrics such as Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, Log Loss, and others.
#### Note: you can use any dataset i am using " weather data " you can download any data from kaggle.com and implement all models given below , we are just going to compare for the given dataset which will be the best model based on calculations and accuracy score .
